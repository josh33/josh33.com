    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>January 30, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Mongolian Vocab</strong> (the “App”) handles information
      when you use it. The App is designed to work entirely offline and does not use external web
      services.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal data collected:</strong> The App does not collect, transmit, or store personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>No accounts:</strong> The App does not require sign-up or login.</li>
      <li><strong>Local-only storage:</strong> Learning progress and settings are saved only on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The App does not include analytics, ads, or tracking SDKs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The App does not request or collect your name, email address, phone number, contacts, photos,
      precise location, or other identifying information. We do not receive any data from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      To provide core functionality, the App stores the following information <strong>only on your device</strong>
      (for example, using on-device storage such as AsyncStorage):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Learning progress:</strong> words you’ve practiced and completion status for daily sessions</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence levels:</strong> your self-assessed mastery of each word (e.g., learning / familiar / mastered)</li>
      <li><strong>Theme preference:</strong> light, dark, or system setting</li>
      <li><strong>Custom vocabulary:</strong> words you add, edit, or delete from the dictionary</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to the developer or any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>Network and External Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not communicate with external servers or web services and does not sync your data.
      An internet connection is not required for the App to function.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics, Tracking, and Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not use analytics services, tracking technologies, or advertising networks. We do not
      track you across apps or websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Haptics (Vibration)</h2>
    <p>
      The App may use your device’s haptic feedback (vibration) to enhance interactions (for example, button
      taps or correct/incorrect feedback). Haptic feedback does not collect or transmit personal data and
      is processed entirely on-device.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share personal information. Because the App does not collect or transmit
      user data, there is no user data to share with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Your App data is stored locally on your device until you delete it. If you delete the App, the locally
      stored data (including progress, preferences, and custom vocabulary) is also deleted as part of the
      App removal process.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not collect personal information from any users, including children. As a result, no
      personal data is collected, stored on servers, or shared for any age group.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Because the App does not collect or store data on external servers, there is no server-side user data
      to secure. Any data saved within the App is stored locally and protected by your device’s operating
      system and security settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated”
      date above. If a future version introduces optional online features or any data collection, this policy will
      be updated before those changes take effect.
    </p>
